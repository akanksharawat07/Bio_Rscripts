# There are several ways to merge two data frames in R, depending on your specific needs. 
# Here are two common approaches:
#1. Use the merge() function: This function allows you to merge two data frames based on a common column or row. For example, if both data frames have a common column called "subject_id", you can use the following code to merge the data frames:
merged_df <- merge(df1, df2, by = "subject_id")
  
#2. Use the join() function from the dplyr package: This function allows you to merge two data frames based on common row names. For example:
library(dplyr)
merged_df <- df1 %>%
left_join(df2, by = "row.names")
# This will merge df1 and df2 based on their row names, keeping all rows from df1 and matching rows from df2.
  
  
# If you want to merge two data frames with different dimensions and different row names, you can use the merge() function in combination with the na.omit() function. The na.omit() function will remove rows with missing values, so you can use it to remove rows that don't have a match in the other data frame.
# Merge the two data frames
merged_df <- merge(df1, df2, by = "row.names", all = TRUE)

# Remove rows with missing values
clean_df <- na.omit(merged_df)
# This will merge the two data frames based on their row names, keeping all rows from both data frames. It will then remove any rows with missing values, resulting in a data frame with only the rows that have a match in both data frames.
